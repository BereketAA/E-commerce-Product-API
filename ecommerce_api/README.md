The E-commerce Product API is a Web based  service designed for managing an e-commerce platform's product catalog. 
This API enables users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products, 
search for products by name or category, and authenticate users to secure operations. 
Built with Django REST Framework, it provides scalable, secure, and efficient functionality for any e-commerce application.
